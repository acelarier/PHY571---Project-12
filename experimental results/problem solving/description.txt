description of pictures :

relaxation va.png --> simulation results (obtained on wed. 24 nov.) for 
	N = 100
	L = 25
	noise = 0.1
	speed = 0.03
we observe that the average speed takes time to reach its equilibrium value


fluctuations.png --> shows the order parameter fluctuations for various situations


fluctuationsFlattened.png --> idem but after averaging over 100 time steps
