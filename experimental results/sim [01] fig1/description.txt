these experiments aim to reproduce the results shown in Vicsek 1995, fig1 (see biblio [02]

the figure shows four frame where showing four pools of particules evoluting according to a simple behavior rule (see article) with parameters :

(a) state at time=0 for all trials
(b) L = 7 , eta = 2
(c) L = 25, eta = 0.1
(d) L = 5 , eta = 0.1

with, for all trial we have N = 300 and v = 0.03



sim_b = results for (b)
sim_c ... ... ... . (c)
